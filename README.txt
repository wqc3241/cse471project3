Game Instructions:
The objective of this game is to destroy all the approaching enemies.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the ship. Use the spacebar to shoot and destroy the enemies.
When all of the enemies are destroyed, you will advance to the next level, and the enemies will become faster, shoot faster, and change enemies.

If the ship gets hit by enemy fire, or the enemies reach your ship, it's game over!
